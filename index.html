      <h2>Personal Information</h2>
      <p>I am 18 years old, born in 2003. My nationality is Italian and Australian, with Italy being from my dad’s side of the family.
      I have completed all years of primary and secondary school and am now studying the bachelor of IT at RMIT. I speak English but can vaguely understand some Italian.
      My spare consists of playing guitar, watching anime, playing video games, and watching or playing sport (AFL, Soccer, Basketball)
      </p>
      <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
      <p>My interest in IT consists of how modern technology can be used in order to solve problems, simple or complex. My interest in IT started from a young age, playing video games on a playstation 2 and browsing the internet on the family computer. Watching minecraft youtube videos is what ultimately made me want to get my own custom pc which further increased my interest in IT by allowing me to use my own pc freely while also opening up the pc and installing and upgrading hardware. I chose to come to RMIT because it is the ‘Institute of Technology’ and I thought that it would be the best for what I wanted to do. I expect to learn about how IT is used, how it will be used in the future and how I can use it. I also expect to learn how to code in several different languages.
