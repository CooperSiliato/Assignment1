      <h2>Personal Information</h2>
      <p>I am 18 years old, born in 2003. My nationality is Italian and Australian, with Italy being from my dad’s side of the family. I have completed all years of primary and secondary school and am now studying the bachelor of IT at RMIT. I speak English but can vaguely understand some Italian. My spare consists of playing guitar, watching anime, playing video games, and watching or playing sport (AFL, Soccer, Basketball)
      </p>
      <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
      <p>My interest in IT consists of how modern technology can be used in order to solve problems, simple or complex. My interest in IT started from a young age, playing video games on a playstation 2 and browsing the internet on the family computer. Watching minecraft youtube videos is what ultimately made me want to get my own custom pc which further increased my interest in IT by allowing me to use my own pc freely while also opening up the pc and installing and upgrading hardware. I chose to come to RMIT because it is the ‘Institute of Technology’ and I thought that it would be the best for what I wanted to do. I expect to learn about how IT is used, how it will be used in the future and how I can use it. I also expect to learn how to code in several different languages.
      </p>
      <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
      <p>This job as a software developer is a position that would require me to work with others in designing and developing software, which includes collaborating with others, maintaining and monitoring systems and solving problems, sharing ideas and reviewing other’s software. To me this job is appealing as it allows me to always be learning, while working with a team with the same mindset and interests that I have. It is also appealing to me as it states that they will train employees so I will learn more about different types of coding and processes. The requirements of this job need me to have a Bachelor level graduate degree in IT and for me to be passionate about programming and have the ability to program with university level skills. They also require the ability to present and communicate. Right now the skills, qualifications and experience I have would include a passion for programming and problem solving, being able to program at the level just over high school experience and communication and presentation skills that still need to be developed further. To fulfil these requirements I will continue to attend and complete the university course that I have enrolled into in order to gain and improve my skills and experience. I will also be actively looking out and seeking any experiences that can further help improve my skills
