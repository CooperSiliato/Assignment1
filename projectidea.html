      <h1>Project idea</h1>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The project will be a way that esports can be viewed digitally through the use of VR. Most of the time esports are viewed through a flat 2D screen, even when the events are an in person tournament people are still watching them play through a 2D screen. My idea is to create a way that people can view esports as if they are watching the footy from the sidelines. For example, you are watching a Rocket League esports match but you are in the in-game crowd watching from seats with other people around you who are also watching and cheering.
      </p>
      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        This will completely change the way that esports is viewed as entertainment by making it more like the way regular sports are consumed and viewed. VR technology has and will continue to improve as it is becoming cheaper and more accessible to everyone, with one of the most popular (and one of the most technologically advanced) headset being the cheapest at $479 aud, without the need for an absolute beast of a computer. Making the market for this service ever growing, combined with the growing popularity of esports, this project will be sure to have a market.
      </p>
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        The service will provide users with an esports viewing experience that replicates the way that sports is viewed, in person at a stadium. The user will be able to tune in to a live esports match from within the game itself, whether this be from in-game stands next to the pitch or from set positions of their choosing from within the map of the game. For example watching the gameplay from the perspective of an in-game Rainbow Six Siege camera, or watching champions battle from the perspective of a bot or turret. Although watching the match from within the game itself would be the main concept, another feature would be the option to view the match from a 2d screen as well, when watching the footy from in the stands, you can also watch it from the big screen that has the scoreboard on it. This feature would be the same concept as this, you will be able to use a portable in-game screen that you can carry around and place where you want while still being inside the game, allowing the user to have multiple perspectives of the match, the user could pin the screen onto a certain place or attach it to their wrist like a watch. The service will also allow users to go to a virtual environment where they are placed in a room, whether that be a living room, a cinema, an esports stadium or environment where the match can be viewed on a flat screen while still being in VR, this feature will suite those who may suffer from motion sickness or are uncomfortable with movement in VR or just prefer to watch the game on a 2d screen. Going back to recreating the experience you get from real sports, the main part is the crowd, with this service you will be able to view these esport matches with others who are also in VR, you will be able to converse with others, mute them if you choose to and interact with them, there will be a choice from a public lobby where a large amount of people can gather, which gives the real crowd experience, or a private one where you can invite select people or view the match by yourself to get an experience that is more quieter and like a chill hangout. Another feature that the service will provide is the ability to change seats or viewing locations at any time that the user seems fit, if there is action going on at B bombsite but the user is still at A, they can teleport to a different set location on the other side of the map near B with a simple button push

      <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
      <p>
        The tools needed for this project would include VR technology, if possible of all kinds in order to test how different headsets react and how they could change the research and development. Software for this project may be quite difficult as not every game is coded in the same language or use the same rendering engine, this may cause issues as these games were never intended to support VR, it may also require a different application for each different game essentially coding the same thing but in different languages in order to be used in different games.
      </p>
      <h2>Skills Required</h2>
      <p>
        The skills required for this project will include game development, specifically specialising in VR game or software development. The nature of this project may cause it to be very difficult or not possible to implement as it requires to be used within a service that is already available to use, it requires to be created inside an already existing game, and further causing an issue is the fact that if the service works within one game, it may not in another as different games are coded differently and use different engines and languages, which again could cause major issues in completing this project. Despite this the hardware will be easy to find as VR is very accessible to the public and a computer to create the software will not need to be excessively powerful.
      </p>
      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>
        If the project is successful, I believe that the outcome would be positive as the market for VR headsets and the market for esports share a lot in common, being people who enjoy video games and want to experience them to the fullest and best extent that they possibly can. The original problem will be solved by allowing viewers and fans to have an experience with their favourite team and or game that could not be possible before this service existed. This impact will hugely further help the esports community as it will provide an experience of viewing competitive sports that is like no other, it would be like viewing real sports but with added features that would not be possible without a virtual environment that this service will provide.
